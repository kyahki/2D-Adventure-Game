## Introduction

This project serves as a hands-on exploration of OOP concepts within the context of game development. By building this game, I aimed to solidify my understanding of Java programming and game design patterns.

## Features

- **Character Movement**: Navigate the game world using intuitive controls.
- **Interactive NPCs**: Engage with non-player characters to advance the storyline.
- **Inventory System**: Collect and manage items found throughout the adventure.
- **Combat Mechanics**: Battle enemies using a turn-based combat system.
- **Save/Load Functionality**: Save your progress and resume your journey at any time.
